# Bring your own thesis!

Some files (schedule, posters etc.) related to an informal student meeting
where people can talk about their theses or other interesting topics.

This repository contains some material that is not own work of the organizers
(logo of the student council, abstracts of talks etc.) and hence is not
intended for reuse.
