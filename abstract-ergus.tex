\section{Loop Objects in Pointed Derivators (Aras Ergus)}

Derivators provide an abstract framework for homotopy
theory. In particular, many statements from (classical) homotopy theory
can be formulated and proven for certain kinds of derivators. My thesis
is about one such statement, namely a ``derivator version'' of the fact that
the loop spaces have a canonical group object structure in the homotopy
category of topological spaces.
